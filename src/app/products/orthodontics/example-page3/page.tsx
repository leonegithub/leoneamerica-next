            <div className="py-2">
              <p>
                Made of stainless steel and biomedical techno polymer. <br />
                The male screw is not in contact with the orthodontic acrylic
                resin: the function of the screw will not be influenced by the
                quality of the technical procedure and a non-compliant curing
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Continuous expansion movement: the high pressure injection of
                the polymer allows the perfect copy of the male thread of the
                screw thus ensuring a steady expansion transmission without the
                risk of undesired turning back in the mouth. <br />
                The self-centering rectangular guides ensure a biomechanical and
                absolutely controlled symmetrical expansion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flat shape of the guides and their flexibility allow the
                gradual release of the expansion with a physiological
                orthodontic movement. <br />
                The flexibility of the screw allows the adjustments of any
                dental regress due to inconsistent use of the appliance by the
                patient, thus being very effective with holding devices
                following a rapid expansion treatment. <br />
                The high adaptability of the appliance enables a comfortable
                application in the mouth in the days following re-activation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two embossed arrows on the body indicate the direction of
                opening. When using a color of acrylic resin similar to the
                polymer body, a white arrow provided with the plastic placement
                tab may be easily applied to make the direction of activation
                visible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The placement plastic tab, made of two pieces combined with a
                unique geometry, allows a perfect protection of the holes from
                the acrylic resin during the packing procedure and facilitates
                the removal after the curing cycle. <br />
                The screw body is available in 6 colors.
